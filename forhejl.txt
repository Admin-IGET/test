is it true that somebody can acces your firewall for a split second when they kill you in minecraft or is HEJLOVEC making stuff up again?


ChatGPT Å™ekl:
HEJLOVEC is definitely making stuff up again. No, killing someone in Minecraft does not give access to their firewall, even for a split second. Thatâ€™s not how either Minecraft or computer security works.

Hereâ€™s why:

Minecraft is a sandbox game, not a hacking tool. Killing another player in the game is a normal game mechanic with no connection to your operating system, firewall, or network settings.

A firewall is part of your operating system or router, and it's protected by system-level permissions. A Minecraft playerâ€”no matter what they do in-gameâ€”can't reach into your computer's network configuration just by interacting with you in Minecraft.

If you're playing on a server, then the only IPs exposed are the ones involved in the connection (you to server, server to you). A player could guess your IP under rare circumstances (e.g. in peer-to-peer LAN games), but even then, that's not access to your firewall.

In short: it's 100% false. It's probably just another fake video from HEJLOVEC, if you're referring to the Czech YouTuber @Hejlovec. ðŸ˜„

You dont have access to my system rn, right?


ChatGPT Å™ekl:
Correct â€” I do not and cannot access your system.

I donâ€™t have any way to:

See your files

Access your network or firewall

Read your IP address or location

Interact with your computer in any way

All I can do is respond to the messages you send me here in this chat. Think of me like a very advanced calculator that only knows what you tell it â€” nothing more.
